**Online Library Management System**
Managing a library requires a lot of time and effort, especially when there are a large number of books and users. Some of the common challenges faced by library administrators include book inventory management, user registration, book lending, late fee management, book reservation, and maintaining the library's database.
To overcome these challenges, a Library Management System (LMS) can be developed. The LMS can be designed as a computerized system that can automate the library's day-to-day operations, making the process more efficient and reducing the workload of the library staff.
